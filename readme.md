# packman-Algorithms: implementing AI Argorithms to finish the game: as fast as possible and without getting eaten by the ghosts.

This project was implemented in Java. The idea is to calculate a solution for the pacman to finish the game on itself.

Without Ghosts: 5 Alrothims(Depth First Search, Breadth-first search, Greedy search, UCS and A*) were implemented to find the shortest way to eat all the dots.
The amount of steps will be printed out for each algorithm to compare the solutions.
Algorithm can be picked with user input in terminal.

With Ghost: Markov decision process was implemented to try and eat as many dots and finish the game with Ghosts around.
